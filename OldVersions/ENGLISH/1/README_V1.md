# Why you should stop using Google search

![Google_2015_logo.svg](Google_2015_logo.svg)

This is an article on why you should stop using the Google search engine. The search engine has many problems, and is a major problem. There are many other good search engines to use instead.

For inexperienced tech users, you should know that the Google search engine doesn't contain all of the Internets content, it is just a way of accessing it. All sites on the Google search engine can still be accessed with other search engines, sometimes with better performance. Google search also has a problem, where searches redirect you to Google AMP [which you should avoid as well](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Why-you-should-avoid-Google-AMP/)

## Overview

Like other Google products, Google Search has a history of privacy and performance issues. The search engine originally grew to prominence in 1998 to the mid 2000s due to its record search performance. Unfortunately, Google doesn't care about the performance anymore (they haven't since 2008) and they focus more on how many ads they can serve you, and how much info they can get from you.

General description [from Wikipedia: Google_Classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Search) - Data from Februry 18th 2021 at 4:27:09 pm (PT: Pacific Time)

Google Search, or simply Google, is a web search engine developed by Google LLC. It is the most used search engine on the World Wide Web across all platforms, with 92.16% market share as of December 2020, handling more than 5.4 billion searches each day.

The order of search results returned by Google is based, in part, on a priority rank system called "PageRank". Google Search also provides many different options for customized searches, using symbols to include, exclude, specify or require certain search behavior, and offers specialized interactive experiences, such as flight status and package tracking, weather forecasts, currency, unit, and time conversions, word definitions, and more.

The main purpose of Google Search is to search for text in publicly accessible documents offered by web servers, as opposed to other data, such as images or data contained in databases. It was originally developed in 1997 by Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Scott Hassan. In June 2011, Google introduced "Google Voice Search" to search for spoken, rather than typed, words. In May 2012, Google introduced a Knowledge Graph semantic search feature in the U.S.

Analysis of the frequency of search terms may indicate economic, social and health trends. Data about the frequency of use of search terms on Google can be openly inquired via Google Trends and have been shown to correlate with flu outbreaks and unemployment levels, and provide the information faster than traditional reporting methods and surveys. As of mid-2016, Google's search engine has begun to rely on deep neural networks.

Competitors of Google include Baidu and Soso.com in China; Naver.com and Daum.net in South Korea; Yandex in Russia; Seznam.cz in the Czech Republic; Qwant in France; Yahoo in Japan, Taiwan and the US, as well as Bing and DuckDuckGo. Some smaller search engines offer facilities not available with Google, e.g. not storing any private or tracking information.

Within the U.S., as of July 2018, Bing handled 24.2 percent of all search queries. During the same period, Oath (formerly known as Yahoo) had a search market share of 11.5 percent. Market leader Google generated 63.2 percent of all core search queries in the U.S.

Privacy on Google products is always bad, due to all Google products containing spyware.

No matter what you do, when you are using Google, all of your sensitive personal data is being sent to Google and others. Google has also been spotted going through open programs. For example, from personal experience (on Firefox) with a YouTube tab open that I didn't visit, I watched several videos offline (VLC Media Player) Later when I went to check the recommendations, it was nearly everything that I had watched. There is no doubt they are spying on other programs too.

In Chrome (and many other browsers) an incognito mode is present. In Chrome, this mode is pointless, as Google will still mine your data. Even if you turn data mining/tracking off, and enable the "do not track" signal, surprise suprise, Google is still mining your data.

If you think you have nothing to hide, **you are absolutely wrong**. This argument has been debunked many times over:

[Via Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_to_hide_argument#Criticism)

1. Edward Snowden remarked "Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say. "When you say, ‘I have nothing to hide,’ you’re saying, ‘I don’t care about this right.’ You’re saying, ‘I don’t have this right, because I’ve got to the point where I have to justify it.’ The way rights work is, the government has to justify its intrusion into your rights."

2. Daniel J. Solove stated in an article for The Chronicle of Higher Education that he opposes the argument; he stated that a government can leak information about a person and cause damage to that person, or use information about a person to deny access to services even if a person did not actually engage in wrongdoing, and that a government can cause damage to one's personal life through making errors. Solove wrote "When engaged directly, the nothing-to-hide argument can ensnare, for it forces the debate to focus on its narrow understanding of privacy. But when confronted with the plurality of privacy problems implicated by government data collection and use beyond surveillance and disclosure, the nothing-to-hide argument, in the end, has nothing to say."

3. Adam D. Moore, author of Privacy Rights: Moral and Legal Foundations, argued, "it is the view that rights are resistant to cost/benefit or consequentialist sort of arguments. Here we are rejecting the view that privacy interests are the sorts of things that can be traded for security." He also stated that surveillance can disproportionately affect certain groups in society based on appearance, ethnicity, sexuality, and religion.

4. Bruce Schneier, a computer security expert and cryptographer, expressed opposition, citing Cardinal Richelieu's statement "If one would give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest man, I would find something in them to have him hanged", referring to how a state government can find aspects in a person's life in order to prosecute or blackmail that individual. Schneier also argued "Too many wrongly characterize the debate as 'security versus privacy.' The real choice is liberty versus control."

5. Harvey A. Silverglate estimated that the common person, on average, unknowingly commits three felonies a day in the US.

6. Emilio Mordini, philosopher and psychoanalyst, argued that the "nothing to hide" argument is inherently paradoxical. People do not need to have "something to hide" in order to hide "something". What is hidden is not necessarily relevant, claims Mordini. Instead, he argues an intimate area which can be both hidden and access-restricted is necessary since, psychologically speaking, we become individuals through the discovery that we could hide something to others.

7. Julian Assange stated "There is no killer answer yet. Jacob Appelbaum (@ioerror) has a clever response, asking people who say this to then hand him their phone unlocked and pull down their pants. My version of that is to say, 'well, if you're so boring then we shouldn't be talking to you, and neither should anyone else', but philosophically, the real answer is this: Mass surveillance is a mass structural change. When society goes bad, it's going to take you with it, even if you are the blandest person on earth."

8. Ignacio Cofone, law professor, argues that the argument is mistaken in its own terms because, whenever people disclose relevant information to others, they also disclose irrelevant information. This irrelevant information has privacy costs and can lead to other harms, such as discrimination.

Google search is the same as all other Google products, it contains spyware, as Google is not just a search company, they are a user data company, and you are the product. To Google, you are only worth about $700.00 (unless you are making them ad revenue)

## Alternative solutions

Google Search is very easy to get away from, and unlike other Google products, degoogling isn't very hard, as no data is completely reliant on the engine.

Here are some alternative solutions:

* DuckDuckGo (Privacy focused search engine that offers very high functionality, and doesn't track you. If you turn off safe search, DuckDuckGo can also be used to browse some of the dark web (although not all of it, unless you are using Tor. DuckDuckGo currently gets over 2 billion searches per month (As of February 2021) has lots of customization (including multiple built-in dark modes) a privacy extension that tells you the privacy grade of a website, and no targeted advertisements (instead of stalking you to try and give you "better ads" DuckDuckGo will give you ads based on what you search on. So if you search something like "wooden table" DuckDuckGo will give you ads for wooden tables. [Start searching with DuckDuckGo, click here for the short URL](https://duck.com) [Click here for the normal link](https://www.duckduckgo.com) [Click here for the Safe mode normal link](https://safe.duckduckgo.com)

* Ecosia (another privacy focused search engine with high functionality, but less customization. Ecosia generates revenue for every search you make, every 45-100 searches will result in 1 tree being planteed. Currently, Ecosia has planted over 119,957,709 trees, and has 15 million active users) [Start searching with Ecosia, click here](https://www.ecosia.org/)

* Bing (owned by Microsoft, but still a good search engine. Privacy isn't nearly as bas as Google search, and it gives good results) [Start searching with Bing, click here](https://www.bing.com)

* Yahoo (not the best search engine, but still better than Google. Results may not be as good) [Start searching with Yahoo! click here](https://search.yahoo.com/)

* Yandex (not recommended, based in Russia, and may not be trustable. It is the Google of Russia) [Подожди нет, не надо](https://yandex.com/)

***

## Anti-competitive behavior

![chromedownloadgif.gif](chromedownloadgif.gif)

Google search is very anti-competitive. If you don't use Google Chrome, using any other browser will result in Google continuously bugging you to switch to Chrome (the above example shows 3 different popups just for going to https://www.google.com from another browser)

***

## Censorship

Google search is a censored search engine. Google filters out results it doesn't agree with, so searches are biased.

***

## Ads

Google search uses an excessive amount of ads. In some instances, making a search will result in the entire first page being ads, which results in extra work to try to find what you are looking for.

***

## Racism

Googles image search engine has been a deal of controversy for many years. Here are some notable examples of racism:

In 2015 to 2018, Google came under controversy for a racist search result. If users typed in the word "gorilla" pictures of African Americans showed up. After much controversy, Google made a weak apology, then as their solution, they censored the results of the word Gorilla and just removed the ability to search for it, instead of trying to fix the bias.

**Sources:** [1](https://www.cnet.com/news/google-apologizes-for-algorithm-mistakenly-calling-black-people-gorillas/) [2](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/12/google-racism-ban-gorilla-black-people) [3](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/07/01/google-apologizes-after-photos-identify-black-people-as-gorillas/29567465/) [4](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/01/google-sorry-racist-auto-tag-photo-app) [5](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/12/16882408/google-racist-gorillas-photo-recognition-algorithm-ai) [6](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mzhang/2015/07/01/google-photos-tags-two-african-americans-as-gorillas-through-facial-recognition-software/) [7](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-5270891/Google-bans-word-gorilla-racist-Photos-app.html) [8](https://petapixel.com/2015/07/02/google-apologizes-after-photos-app-autotags-black-people-as-gorillas/)

Some more examples [Excerpt from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Search#Big_Data_and_human_bias)

Google search engine robots are programmed to use algorithms that understand and predict human behavior. The book, Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code by Ruha Benjamin talks about human bias as a behavior that the google search engine can recognize. In 2016, some users google searched "three Black teenagers" and images of criminal mugshots of young African American teenagers came up. Then, the users searched "three White teenagers" and were presented with photos of smiling, happy teenagers. They also searched for "three Asian teenagers", and very revealing photos of Asian girls and women appeared. Benjamin concluded that these results reflect human prejudice and views on different ethnic groups. A group of analysts explained the concept of a racist computer program: "The idea here is that computers, unlike people, can't be racist but we're increasingly learning that they do in fact take after their makers...Some experts believe that this problem might stem from the hidden biases in the massive piles of data that the algorithms process as they learn to recognize patterns...reproducing our worst values".

## Sweden lawsuit

In 2013, Google successfully blocked the Swedish language council from adding the new word "ogooglebar" (English: ungoogleable) to the Swedish language. The language council of Sweden accused Google of trying to control the Swedish language.

Also note that the company name Google isn't original either, it is just a minor misspelling of the mathematic term Googol (1 Googol is equal to: `10^100` which equals: `10,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000` - 1 followed by 100 zeroes)

## Search engine manipulation

The Google search engine gets manipulated a lot. This can cause harm to many businesses. For example, in the early 2010s, JCPenney was censored by Google, causing the company to lose a significant amount of revenue, and caused their business to almost fail.
